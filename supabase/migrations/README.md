# Migrations

Migrations are numbered sequentially. The gap between 005 and 008 is intentional:
migrations 006 and 007 were applied directly to the hosted Supabase project and were
not committed to the repo. Do NOT renumber existing migrations — Supabase tracks applied
migrations by filename. If you need to reference what 006/007 contained, check the
Supabase dashboard's migration history.
