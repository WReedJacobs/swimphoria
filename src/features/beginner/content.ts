    stroke: 'Freestyle',
    blurb:
      'The fastest and most common competitive stroke. You lie on your front, rotating your body as you pull alternating arms through the water while kicking your legs in a continuous flutter.',
    breathing:
      'Rotate your head to the side — not up — so one goggle stays in the water. Inhale through your mouth in the pocket of air formed by your bow wave, then return your face immediately to the water. Most swimmers breathe every 3 strokes (bilateral), which keeps the stroke balanced. Every 2 strokes is fine if you need more air.',
    whyItMatters:
      'Freestyle is the most efficient stroke per metre — improving it gives you the biggest fitness return per session and forms the core of almost every training plan.',
    beginnerPriority:
      'Learn this first. Freestyle is the most efficient and versatile stroke. Once you can swim a length of freestyle with controlled breathing, everything else builds from that foundation.',
    sequence: [
      'Entry — hand enters the water fingertips first, in line with your shoulder, arm extended.',
      'Extension — arm fully extends forward as your body rotates slightly, hip driving forward.',
      'Catch — elbow bends early underwater, forearm faces backward to grip the water (early vertical forearm).',
      'Pull — forearm sweeps back powerfully under your body, elbow high, hand tracking toward your hip.',
      'Finish — hand exits the water near your hip with a final push; thumb faces down.',
      'Recovery — elbow leads the arm back over the water, hand relaxed and trailing.',
    ],
    tips: [
      'Keep your body long and flat, like an arrow pointing at the far wall.',
      'Rotate your shoulders with each pull — 15 to 45 degrees each side. Rotation is power.',
      'Turn your head to breathe, not lift it. One goggle stays in the water.',
      'Kick from the hips with loose, relaxed ankles — not from the knee.',
      'Enter your hand in line with your shoulder, not across the centreline.',
      'Bend your elbow early underwater — the "catch" — and think "show your armpit".',
      'Finish the stroke with your hand near your hip before your arm exits the water.',
    ],
    mistakes: [
      'Lifting the head to breathe — your hips drop immediately and create drag.',
      'Crossing the centreline with your hand entry — causes your hips to snake side to side.',
      'Kicking from the knee — bend the knee only slightly and drive from the hip.',
      'Not rotating the body — you lose the power of your large back and shoulder muscles.',
      'Pulling with a flat wrist and straight elbow — the forearm drives the pull, not just the hand.',
      'Forgetting to finish the stroke — your hand should reach your hip before it exits.',
    ],
    coachSpeak: [
      { phrase: 'High elbow recovery', meaning: 'During the arm recovery over the water, keep the elbow up and let the hand trail. Prevents a wide, flailing arm.' },
      { phrase: 'Early vertical forearm (EVF)', meaning: 'As soon as your hand enters, bend the elbow so your forearm faces backward — your largest pull surface.' },
      { phrase: 'Catch phase', meaning: 'The moment your hand grabs the water and you feel resistance. Everything before this is just setup.' },
      { phrase: 'Bilateral breathing', meaning: 'Breathing to both sides, typically every 3 strokes. Balances muscle use and keeps your stroke symmetrical.' },
      { phrase: 'DPS', meaning: 'Distance per stroke — how far you travel per arm cycle. Fewer strokes per length means better efficiency.' },

  {
    stroke: 'Backstroke',
    blurb:
      'The only competitive stroke swum on your back. You pull with alternating arms while flutter-kicking, staring upward at the ceiling. Navigation is the main challenge.',
    breathing:
      'Your face is never submerged, so you can breathe freely. Most swimmers develop a rhythm — breathe in as one arm enters the water, out as the other enters. The key is to keep breathing relaxed rather than holding your breath out of habit.',
    whyItMatters:
      'Backstroke is ideal for recovery sets and aerobic base building because breathing is unrestricted. It also counteracts the forward-hunched position of freestyle, making it important for posture and shoulder health.',
    beginnerPriority:
      'Learn this second. Backstroke is the ideal complement to freestyle — breathing is free, it strengthens your posterior muscles, and it gives you a mental rest during sets. The navigation challenge is real but manageable once you know your stroke count from the flags.',
    sequence: [
      'Entry — little-finger-first entry, arm extended in line with your shoulder.',
      'Extension — arm sinks slightly as your shoulder rotates under and your body rolls to that side.',
      'Catch — elbow bends, wrist flexes, forearm faces toward your feet.',
      'Pull — forearm sweeps toward your hip in an S-shaped path.',
      'Finish — hand pushes down near your hip, palm facing the pool floor.',
      'Recovery — arm exits thumb-first, swings over the water and enters again.',
    ],
    tips: [
      'Keep your ears in the water and eyes looking straight up — not forward.',
      'Roll your shoulders with each stroke, same rotation principle as freestyle.',
      'Enter your hand with the little finger first, arm in line with your shoulder.',
      'Count your strokes from the flags (5m from the wall) — know your number.',
      'Keep a steady flutter kick throughout to keep your hips from sinking.',
      'Press the back of your head into the water to keep your hips up.',
      'Push all the way through the pull — finish near your hip, not your chest.',
    ],
    mistakes: [
      'Sitting up so the hips drop below the water surface.',
      'Bending at the waist during the pull.',
      'Slapping the water flat on entry instead of entering with the little finger.',
      'Letting both arms move simultaneously — one arm should always be pulling.',
      'Not knowing your stroke count from the flags — swimmers hit walls regularly.',
      'Stopping the kick during the arm pull phase.',
    ],
    coachSpeak: [
      { phrase: 'Pinky-first entry', meaning: 'Rotate your hand so the little finger enters first — avoids a splashy flat-hand entry.' },
      { phrase: 'Flag count', meaning: 'The number of arm strokes you take after passing under the 5m flags before the wall.' },
      { phrase: 'Hip rotation', meaning: 'Rolling your hips with each stroke — same principle as freestyle, just on your back.' },
      { phrase: 'Streamline off the wall', meaning: 'Push off tightly with arms squeezed by your ears before surfacing.' },
      { phrase: 'Underwaters', meaning: 'The dolphin-kick phase under the surface after the push-off — the fastest part of your race.' },

  {
    stroke: 'Breaststroke',
    blurb:
      "A rhythmic stroke swum on your front with a simultaneous arm pull and a frog kick. It's the only stroke where the legs provide most of the propulsion.",
    breathing:
      'Breathe during the pull phase — as your arms sweep out and your chest naturally rises, lift your chin forward and inhale. Drop your face back into the water as your arms stretch forward into the glide. Never breathe during the kick or the glide.',
    whyItMatters:
      'Breaststroke is the most common recreational stroke. Its glide phase makes long swims naturally restorative, and mastering the timing makes it far less tiring than it initially feels.',
    beginnerPriority:
      'Learn this third. Breaststroke timing is the trickiest of the four strokes to master — pulling and kicking at the same time feels natural but produces a slow, inefficient stroke. Give yourself time with the sequence before worrying about speed.',
    sequence: [
      'Glide — body is in a tight streamline, face down, arms extended, momentum carrying you forward.',
      'Pull — arms sweep outward to shoulder-width, elbows high, hands angled down.',
      'Breathe — as arms sweep in and chest rises, chin comes forward to inhale.',
      'Recovery — hands draw together under the chin, palms facing each other, elbows tucking in.',
      'Kick — heels draw up toward the glutes, feet evert outward, then snap together in a circular whip.',
      'Return to glide — hold streamline for a beat before the next cycle.',
    ],
    tips: [
      'Sequence every stroke: pull, breathe, kick, glide — in that order, every time.',
      'Stretch into a full streamline after every kick — the glide is free speed.',
      'Point your feet outward before the kick snap and bring them together at the end.',
      'Keep your hips high during the glide — do not let them sink.',
      'Pull your arms only as wide as your shoulders — wider slows you down.',
      'Recover your hands under your chin, palms together, thumbs pointing down.',
      'Keep the kick narrow and snappy — wider is not more powerful.',
    ],
    mistakes: [
      'Rushing the cycle and skipping the glide — you lose free speed from momentum.',
      'A flutter kick or asymmetric kick instead of a proper whip kick.',
      'Lifting the whole upper body and elbows out of the water to breathe.',
      'Pulling too wide — it creates drag and kills your timing.',
      'Starting the next pull before the kick has finished.',
      'Not pointing the feet outward before the kick snap.',
    ],
    coachSpeak: [
      { phrase: 'Whip kick', meaning: 'The frog-style kick where heels draw up toward the glutes and feet snap together.' },
      { phrase: 'Pull-breathe-kick-glide', meaning: 'The full breaststroke sequence in order. Saying it as you swim helps maintain timing.' },
      { phrase: 'Glide phase', meaning: 'The streamlined pause after the kick, where you hold a tight arrow shape and coast.' },
      { phrase: 'Undulation', meaning: 'A subtle wave-like motion through the upper body during the pull and recovery.' },
      { phrase: 'Two-hand touch', meaning: 'Required on every turn and finish — both hands must touch simultaneously at the same level.' },

  {
    stroke: 'Butterfly',
    blurb:
      'The most physically demanding stroke. Both arms pull simultaneously while your body generates a dolphin-like undulation — two kicks per arm cycle.',
    breathing:
      'Breathe forward, not upward. Your chin should barely clear the water surface. Lift your head too high and your hips drop, killing the body wave. Most swimmers breathe every 2 strokes in training; breathing every stroke causes a head-lift that collapses the rhythm.',
    whyItMatters:
      'Butterfly builds more shoulder strength and core stability than any other stroke. Even swimming it in short sets — 25m at a time — transfers directly to power and coordination in freestyle.',
    beginnerPriority:
      'Learn this last — and it is completely optional for fitness swimmers. Butterfly is not required for general pool swimming, and many experienced swimmers never develop it. If you want to try it, master the dolphin kick first (using fins helps enormously), then add the arms.',
    sequence: [
      'Entry — both hands enter shoulder-width apart, fingertips first, elbows slightly bent.',
      'First kick — a downward dolphin kick fires as the hands enter, driving the chest down.',
      'Catch — hands sweep outward, then bend the elbow to grip the water.',
      'Pull — forearms sweep back powerfully inside shoulder-width toward the hips.',
      'Breathe — chin skims forward just above the surface as hands push past the hips.',
      'Second kick — fires as hands exit the water near the hips, driving the body forward.',
      'Recovery — arms swing forward low over the water, entering for the next stroke.',
    ],
    tips: [
      'Two kicks per arm cycle: one as hands enter the water, one as they exit.',
      'Initiate the undulation from your chest, not your head or hips.',
      'Enter hands shoulder-width apart — not crossing and not too wide.',
      'Pull your hands back just inside shoulder-width during the pull.',
      'Breathe forward with chin low to the water surface — your hips will stay higher.',
      'Keep the rhythm smooth and consistent — forcing more power usually kills it.',
      'Use short fins when learning — the extra propulsion makes the timing much clearer.',
    ],
    mistakes: [
      'Kicking from the knee rather than the hip — limits power significantly.',
      'Lifting the head too high to breathe — hips drop and the wave collapses.',
      'Only doing one kick per stroke — the second kick drives the arm exit.',
      'Pulling too wide with the arms — forces the hips lower.',
      'Rushing the hand entry — hands should land before the second kick fires.',
      'Trying to breathe every stroke — every two strokes is more manageable.',
    ],
    coachSpeak: [
      { phrase: 'Two-beat kick', meaning: 'Two dolphin kicks per arm cycle — one at entry, one at exit.' },
      { phrase: 'Chest-down', meaning: 'The chest drives the undulation downward first, not the hips.' },
      { phrase: 'First kick / second kick', meaning: 'First kick drives your hands in; second kick drives your hips up as hands exit.' },
      { phrase: 'Undulation', meaning: 'The full-body wave that powers butterfly — hips up and down in opposition to the chest.' },
      { phrase: 'Hand pitch', meaning: 'The angle of your hand during entry — thumbs slightly down for a clean, bubbleless entry.' },

}

  {
    question: 'Why am I exhausted after 2 lengths?',
    answer: "Swimming uses muscles you've never loaded this way, requires precise timing between breathing and movement, and offers zero chance to coast. A fit runner will be gasping after 50m and feel completely confused. This is normal. It passes in 3–4 weeks as your body adapts. Don't measure your swimming fitness against your running or gym fitness — they don't transfer the way you expect.",
  },
  {
    question: 'Why should I swim slower to get faster?',
    answer: 'Going flat out every length trains your body to use technique that falls apart under fatigue. Easy swimming at correct technique builds the movement patterns that last. Most improvements in swimming come from better technique, not more effort. Your threshold pace (CSS) is where the most fitness gains happen — not your sprint pace.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Why are intervals better than just swimming straight?',
    answer: 'Swimming 20 × 50m with 15s rest gives you more total quality distance than swimming 1,000m straight, because you can hold better technique and pace on each rep. The rest lets you recover enough to maintain form. Straight swims build endurance; intervals build speed, technique, and fitness faster.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How do I count laps without losing track?',
    answer: "Count by 25m, not by 'lengths' or 'laps' (the word means different things in different pools). Use a lap counter ring — it costs a few pounds and clicks once per length. Or structure your session so you don't need to count: '8 × 100m' means you just count to 4 lengths per rep and know when you've done 8 reps.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I know I'm getting better?",
    answer: 'Times improve slowly at first. The earlier signs of progress are: needing fewer breaths per length, reaching the wall less desperate, your stroke feeling less chaotic. Your CSS pace is the best single number to track — retest it every 6–8 weeks.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How long should a session be?',
    answer: '45 minutes is a solid beginner session including warm-up and cool-down. Quality beats quantity in swimming. 2,000m done with intention beats 3,000m done sloppy and exhausted. Three sessions a week with at least one rest day between is a good starting cadence.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Should I kick hard the whole time?',
    answer: "Not necessarily. In training, most swimmers use a light 2-beat kick (one kick per arm stroke) during easy laps to save energy, and a faster 6-beat kick during hard sets or races. A hard kick all the time burns out your legs quickly. Build kick strength with dedicated kick sets, then deploy it strategically.",
  },
  {
    question: "What does 'on 2:00' mean?",
    answer: "It means you start each rep every 2 minutes, regardless of when you finish. If you swim 100m in 1:45, you get 15 seconds rest. If you swim it in 1:30, you get 30 seconds rest. Watch the pace clock on the wall and push off when the hand hits the top. This is the core skill of lane swimming.",
